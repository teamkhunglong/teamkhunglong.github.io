My name is Tran Tuan Minh; Security Researcher.

I was coding in high school in 2012. I studied Informatics in High School for Gifted Students (VNU) and Computer Science at the University of Engineering & Technology (VNU).

My works are related to Malware & Software Exploitation. In my free time, I play CTFs. I'm a member of several CTF teams like UET-N/A (UET-CTF), PiggyBird, AceBear, BabyPhD and PwnPHOFun.

I started blogging to share my CTF writeups and IT-related stuff in general. It becomes more and more complicated so the blog evolves itself into this form.

You may want to make contact with me to:
1. Request a tutorial or writeup.
2. Send a job description.
3. Report an error somewhere in this blog.
4. Buy me a beer üç∫

I will take time to respond to any emails I may receive; however, I will block you if you spam my inbox.
